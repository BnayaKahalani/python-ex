# Sometimes, while working with Python strings, we can have a problem in which we need to find the frequency of next character of a particular word in string.

# Input : test_str = 'geeks are for geeksforgeeks', que_word = "geek" 
# Output : {'s': 3} 
# Input : test_str = 'geek', que_word = "geek" 
# Output : {}
